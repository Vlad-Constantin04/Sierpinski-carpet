The program defines a MATLAB function called covor_sierpinski that generates and displays the nth iteration of the Sierpinski carpet fractal.
Explanation:
The code starts by defining a function named covor_sierpinski that can take one input argument, i, which represents the number of iterations for generating the fractal.

If the function is called without specifying a value for i, it defaults to 6 iterations.

The code starts a timer to measure the execution time of the fractal generation.

It initializes a matrix M with a single zero (0). This matrix will eventually represent the Sierpinski carpet.

It enters a loop that runs for i iterations (default is 6). In each iteration:

The M matrix is expanded by adding copies of itself horizontally and vertically, creating a larger matrix with a repeating pattern.

In the center of this expanded matrix, a sub-matrix of ones (1s) is placed. The size of this sub-matrix depends on the current iteration number k.

After generating the Sierpinski carpet matrix, it uses imagesc to display it as an image. The colormap is set to grayscale to create a visual representation of the fractal.

Adjusts the plot settings to make the axes equal and turn off axis labels for a cleaner visual display.
It constructs the fractal by iteratively expanding a matrix and placing a sub-matrix of ones in the center, creating the characteristic pattern of the Sierpinski carpet.
Finally, it displays the generated fractal as an image and reports the execution time.
